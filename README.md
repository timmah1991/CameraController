# CameraController

There are five components to this project:

*Board Schematics/Layout (autodesk EAGLE)

*Enclosure STEP and STL files (Fusion 360)

*Sample Particle Xenon Firmware (Particle IDE)

*Sample Android application (Thunkable)

*Example NodeRED Workflow and integration (Particle Dev Console)

This project is the cumulative effort of the handful of engineering skills that I've been trying to develop over the last few weeks. I think the project came out nicely, after a few bumps in the road with circuit design and layout.
