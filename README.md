# CameraController

There are five components to this project:
*Board Schematics/Layout
*Enclosure STEP and STL files
*Sample Particle Xenon Firmware
*Sample Android application
*Example NodeRED Workflow and integration

This project is the cumulative effort of the handful of engineering skills that I've been trying to develop over the last few weeks. I think the project came out nicely, after a few bumps in the road with circuit design and layout.
